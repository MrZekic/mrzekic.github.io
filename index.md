It features a real-time blacklist, logging capabilities, and a firewall to keep unwanted submissions at bay.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Keep track of all submissions, including timestamps and IP addresses.
- **Firewall Protection**: Block malicious requests before they reach your forms.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple settings to tailor the plugin to your needs.

## Installation

1. **Download the Plugin**: You can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/MrZekic/digitalezen_cf7_antispam/releases).
2. **Upload to WordPress**: Go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin, and select the downloaded file.

4. **Configure Settings**: Go to Settings > DigitaleZen Anti-Spam to configure the plugin according to your needs.

## Usage

After installation, the plugin automatically integrates with Contact Form 7. No additional steps are required to start protecting your forms. You can view logs and adjust settings from the plugin menu in your WordPress dashboard.

## Configuration

To configure the plugin:

1. Go to **Settings > DigitaleZen Anti-Spam**.

3. Save your changes.

You can enable or disable specific features based on your requirements.

## Logging

The logging feature allows you to monitor all submissions made through your forms. You can view details such as:

- Submission time
- IP address
- Submission status (approved/blocked)

This information is crucial for identifying patterns and improving your anti-spam measures.

## Real-Time Blacklist

The real-time blacklist feature checks each submission against a global database of known spammers. If a match is found, the submission is automatically blocked. This feature helps maintain the integrity of your contact forms.

## Firewall Protection

Our firewall protection acts as a barrier against malicious requests. It filters incoming traffic and blocks any harmful submissions before they reach your forms. This layer of security is essential for preventing spam and potential attacks.

## Form Validation

Form validation ensures that only properly formatted submissions are accepted. This feature checks for:

- Required fields
- Valid email formats
- Captcha verification (if enabled)

By validating submissions, you reduce the risk of spam and ensure that your forms collect meaningful data.
